# CSS-Placeholder-and-Label-on-Top
 Put the placeholder at the top of the textbox and it will never disappear whenever you type or if it has value.

Important Note: Bootstrap 4.3.1 is included as CDN. So incase you wonder
the code does not work properly, it is because you have no internet connection
to connect to bootstrap CDN.
